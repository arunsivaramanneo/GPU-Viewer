This project is developed as a basic front-end UI for the command-line outputs of glxinfo, vulkaninfo, clinfo,es2_info and vdpauinfo. 
The application helps in viewing/navigating the OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenCL, EGL and VDPAU Information in ease over command-line.

Please do note that this project does not use any OpenGL,Vulkan or OpenCL programming languages. The entire application works as a wrapper on the glxinfo, vulkaninfo, clinfo, es2_info and vdpauinfo output.
